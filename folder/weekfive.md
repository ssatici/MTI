# Week five

How to merge 2 codes:

Add the smaller code to the bigger code. Check if the same pins are being used - if so, change it.

Put setup code in the same section but rename the setup. Same for void loop. Include new name in function code and in other setup codes.

## Common errors

Ohm Law / Led

Imperfections in the systems: analog components can be damaged, aged

Arduino is very sensitive, can't drive huge loads. Each Pin can provide up to 40mA

Arduino heating up - Disconnect from laptop! Change something in Circuit.

DC Motor ideally with Dio (?) 

More than 12VDS not permitted

Find amount of current on datasheet

Voltage Regulator: buckstep (for solar panels, rechargable batteries, stepper motor)

## Chindogu

Strange / Useless Tool

Kenji Kawakami, Marina Fujiwara, Simone Giertz
