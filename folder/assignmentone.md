# Assignment 1

I followed this tutorial: https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Project-With-the-Ultrasonic-Sensor-HC-SR04-/ and used my ultrasonic distance sensor and LED
I'm not sure if it's working, because the led turns on and off and sometimes it seems to be related to movement, sometimes not.

## Pseudocode

function: detect cat and move toy

input: cat movement (via ultrasonic distance sensor) 

output: toy movement (via servo Mmtor)

if cat closer or equal close as 20; servo motor is active

If cat further than 20; servo motor is deative

IF movement detected close than 10cm

ELSE IF turn off motor

### States
